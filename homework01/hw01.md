# Homework 01

## Q1 - Make your own illustration about `data.table` (10 minutes)

1.1 - ask ChatGPT how to download a file from a URL and save it to a local file

Here is the url: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oceanumeric/data-science-go-small/main/drawio/R-data-table-illustration.drawio


1.2 - use the command returned by ChatGPT to download the file via command line (in the terminal)

1.3 Install the drawio extension in VSCode 

1.4 add some text to the illustration to help youself understand the `data.table` package

1.5 export the illustration as a png file and upload it to your homework repository
by commiting and pushing the file to your homework repository

1.6 you can share your illustration with your classmates if you want by sending the link to me and I will show it to the class


## Q2 - Read a google sheet into data.table (5 minutes)

2.1 - ask ChatGPT how to read a google sheet into a data.table

Here is the link of google sheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ral3hG1AHCuiaWYtB3taCSKuWl_j1_A0aKOTb_uh43E/edit?usp=sharing

2.2 - you might need to debug the command returned by ChatGPT

For instance, I got the following error message:

```
Error in fread(link): Input URL requires https:// connection for which fread() requires 'curl' package which cannot be found. Please install 'curl' using 'install.packages('curl')'.
Traceback:

1. fread(link)
2. stop("Input URL requires https:// connection for which fread() requires 'curl' package which cannot be found. Please install 'curl' using 'install.packages('curl')'.")
```

This means what should I do? (When I type this means what should I do? in ChatGPT, it returns the following answer:)

```r
install.packages("curl")
```

I just want to tell ChatGPT that YOU ARE AMAZING!

![amazing](https://kbimages1-a.akamaihd.net/51439e7b-e162-4696-8e0a-54e1134bf0ea/353/569/90/False/you-are-amazing.jpg)


Try following the instructions in the error message and debug and make sure you will read the google sheet into a data.table. The result should like like this:

```
A data.table: 9 Ã— 3
hello	hello_world	hello_word2
<chr>	<chr>	<chr>
hello	hello	hello
hello	world	tomorrow
hello	hello	will
hello	hello	be
hello	hello	a
hello	hello	great
hello	hello	day
hello	hello	hello
hello	hello	hello
```

## Q3 - practice binomial distribution (10 minutes)

In our survey we have one question about people's attitude towards 
ChatGPT. The question is: "Do you like ChatGPT?" 

We have three possible answers: "Yes", "No", "okay-okay".

3.1 - what kind of data preparation do we need to do before we can use the data to
do inference about the population with binomial distribution?

3.2 - Assume our survey represents the population. What is the probability of only 
getting 30 people who like ChatGPT if you randomly select 100 people from the population?

3.3 - Plot the density and cumulative distribution of the binomial distribution with
parameters you calculate from our survey data.

3.4 - what is the expectation and variance of the binomial distribution with
your parameters?
